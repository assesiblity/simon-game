Starting the Game:

Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
The game will randomly flash one of the colored buttons.
Your task is to remember the sequence of flashes.
Repeating the Sequence:

After the game flashes a sequence of buttons, it's your turn.
Click on the buttons in the same sequence as they were flashed.
For example, if the game flashed yellow, red, green, you should click on the buttons in the same order: yellow, red, green.
Advancing Levels:

If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will advance to the next level.
Each level adds one more button to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging.
Game Over:

If you make a mistake and click the wrong button or fail to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends.
The header will display "Game Over!" along with your score (the level you reached).
The background briefly flashes red to indicate the end of the game.
Restarting the Game:

You can restart the game by pressing any key on your keyboard again.
Enjoy and Repeat:

The game continues with increasing difficulty as you progress through the levels.
Keep playing and see how far you can go!
Remember to focus and concentrate on the sequence of flashes to improve your memory and achieve higher scores. Have fun playing the Simon Says game!
